# ReCollect

## Description

Marketplace for collectors, ReCollect™️, using the Spring Boot framework and applying consistent SQA methods.

ReCollect is a platform that allows users to sell their old collections, from simple things such as figurines sold some years ago in stores to rarer items like limited editions of a certain product (book, game, etc.). Here, the buyers can find items they need in order to complete their collections or even start brand new ones!
